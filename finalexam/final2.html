          <h2>Attachment Styles in Real-Life Dating Situations</h2>
          <p>
            Attachment styles are often described in theory, but they show up in very practical
            ways when you are dating: texting, waiting for replies, deciding whether to commit,
            or handling conflict. This page looks at how each style might feel from the inside.

        <h2>How Attachment Styles Might Show Up on Dates</h2>
        <p>
          These descriptions are simplified and not diagnostic, but they help you notice patterns.
          Remember that people can show a mix of styles or change over time.

        <h2>What Your Body Might Be Telling You</h2>
        <p>
          When you are dating, your body often reacts before your words do. Some examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Racing heart when you do not get an instant reply.</li>
          <li>Heavy, tired feeling when someone is trying to get closer.</li>
          <li>Stomach drop when a tone changes or a joke hits wrong.</li>
          <li>Warm, grounded feeling when you feel seen and respected.</li>
          <li>Feeling frozen or blank when conflict comes up.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These signals are not “too much” or “too dramatic.” They are your nervous system
          trying to keep you safe based on what it has learned. Naming them is the first step
          to responding with care instead of shame.
        </p>

        <h2>Micro Red Flags vs. Green Flags in Dating</h2>
        <p>
          Attachment-aware dating is not about labeling people as “bad” or “good.” It is about
          noticing patterns that tend to be unsafe or safe for your nervous system.
        </p>

        <h3>Examples of Gentle Red Flags</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Consistently ignoring your boundaries or comfort level.</li>
          <li>Making you feel guilty for needing reassurance or space.</li>
          <li>Mocking therapy, mental health, or emotional needs.</li>
          <li>Only warm when you are giving something, cold when you need support.</li>
          <li>Refusing to talk about patterns that clearly hurt you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Examples of Gentle Green Flags</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Respecting your “no” without pushing.</li>
          <li>Following through on what they say they will do.</li>
          <li>Can apologize and repair after tension.</li>
          <li>Curious about your experience instead of defensive.</li>
          <li>Encourages you to have other friendships, hobbies, and support.</li>
        </ul>
