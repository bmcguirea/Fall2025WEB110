          <h2>Why Does Dating Feel So Intense?</h2>
          <p>
            Dating is not just about “vibes” and chemistry. Your brain and nervous system are
            constantly scanning for safety, danger, and connection. Attachment styles describe
            patterns for how people connect, pull close, or pull away in relationships.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you understand your own attachment style, it becomes easier to notice what is
            happening inside you during texting, first dates, and conflict instead of thinking,
            “Something is wrong with me.” This guide is designed to make that science simple.

          This dating guide is for anyone who has ever thought:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Why do I panic when someone does not text back fast enough?”</li>
          <li>“Why do I suddenly lose interest when things start getting serious?”</li>
          <li>“Why do I ignore red flags because I feel such a strong pull?”</li>
          <li>“Why do I feel calm with some people and anxious with others?”</li>
          <li>“How can I date in a way that actually feels safe and honest?”</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Nervous System on a Date</h2>
        <p>
          When you go on a date, your heart, stomach, and thoughts are part of a bigger system:
          your autonomic nervous system. It speeds up when you feel unsure and relaxes when you
          feel safe. Attachment styles are one way to describe how that system expects people
          to treat you based on past experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might notice signs like a racing heart, overthinking, going blank, or feeling
          unusually calm. None of these reactions are “good” or “bad.” They are just data about
          how safe your brain currently feels.
