        <li><strong>Improved Subscription Options</strong>: The subscription options are now simplified and more intuitive, clearly displaying pricing, available discounts, and delivery timelines to make the decision-making process easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Visual Layout</strong>: The design now has a cleaner, more modern layout that better highlights key information like event benefits, pricing, and subscription plans, improving overall readability and user engagement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Canva</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> These design changes led to higher user engagement, increased event sign-ups, and a more efficient subscription process, ultimately driving a smoother attendee journey.</p>
